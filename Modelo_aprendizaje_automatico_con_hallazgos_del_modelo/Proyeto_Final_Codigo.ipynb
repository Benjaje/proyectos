Por otro lado si nosotros nos enfocaramos mas en la rapidez tras haber superado nuestra metrica de 0.75 podrias optar por LightGBM por que es muy rapido en comparacion con los otros modelos, pero como en este caso hemos optado por tener un modelo con el mejor rendiminento en nuestra metrica de roc_auc, nos quedaremos con nuestro modelo XGBoostClassifier."

    "**Observaciones:** Para explicar lo que expresa este grafico tenemos que ver que como el grafico lo hace notar, el hecho de que tengamos valores rojos represtan los valores altos que tenemos en esa caracteristica, si estan en azul representan valores bajos. El hecho de que los valores esten del lado derecho de la linea negra que corre verticalmente el 0 significa que esta aumentanto la probabilidad de cancelacion. Teniendo eso en cuenta voy a dar mis sugerencias de las medidas que se pueden tomar en cuenta para disminuir la taza de cancelacion de contratos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claramente podemos ver que la Caracteristica que influye mas en comparacion de las demas en las cancelaciones de contratos es el plazo de pago, en este grafico podemos visualizar que aquellos que suelen tener un plazo de pago de mes por mes  o de año en año suelen cancelar mucho pero podemos ver muy claramente que aquellas personas que tienen un plazo de pago de 2 años tienen una taza muy baja de cancelacion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Por lo tanto seria muy bueno considerar hallar la forma de como convencer que las personas adquierean planes de dos años, ya sea por medio de dar promociones a personas con paquetes de plazo de pagos de mes y de año a plazos de dos años. Es muy probable que por el hecho de pagar plazos de tiempo mas grandes las personas opten por quedarse con los servicios de la empresa por que ya tienen asegurado servicio por 2 años, en lugar de alguien que tiene por solo un mes le puede resultar muy facil dejar los contractos con la empresa de Telecom e irse a otra empresa que de servicios similares."

    "**Observaviones:** En este grafico de barras confirma lo que acabamos de decir al mostrarnos que la caracteristica que principalmente influye en si un cliente cancela o no es el plazo de pago de dos meses. Esto se puede deber a varias razones como el hecho de que la empresa se ha enfocado mas en encontrar nuevos clientes y quizas lo logra por medio de dar promociones en paquetes de mes por mes, seria mejor enfocarnos en poder retener mas clientes al ofrecerles plazos de dos años y a la vez tambien hallar nuevos clientes pero que sean atraidos por paquetes de plazo de dos años y no de mes en mes."

    "1. Nuestro mejor modelo es un `XGBoost Classifier con un valor roc_auc de aproximadamente: '0.925' logrando haber superado nuestra meta inicial.\n",
    "2. En este proyecto logramos notar desde un inicio que se nos proporciono un conjunto de datos que nos daba muy poca informacion sobre aquellos tipos de clientes que cancelaban por lo cual nos ayudo a saber que para mejorar los resultados de nuestros modelos seria bueno hacer un sobremuestreo, notamos claramente como esto ayudo a elevar la calificacion roc_auc de nuestros modelos.\n",
    "3. Con base al analisis realizado mi sugerencia para bajar la taza de cancelacion de los contratos es hacer que los clientes que ya tiene la empresa que obtengan el plan de plazo de 2 años y que si la empresa busca nuevos clientes trate de hacer el esfuerzo para tambien atraerlos con plazos de 2 años, lo cual ayudara significativamente a bajar la taza de cancelacion de los contratos.\n",
